# Lab

Web application that exposes bootstrapped Clojurescript REPL and provides simple tools to
make ad-hoc dashboards, data visualizations or such when in need. You can use it via the
built in REPL window or use the CLJS REPL through nREPL with your editor.

It also supports retrieving and passing live data to views using websocket. This is handy
if you want to have live updates from a production system.

## Sessions

The default session is stored on evaluation, in case you might press reload in the middle
of implementation.

You can list sessions using `(lab.core/list-sessions!)`, load sessions with
`(lab.core/load-session! <session-name>)` and store them using `(lab.core/store-session!  <session-name>)`.

The application hosts default sessions that are stored in `src/lab/experiments` folder.

## Screenshot

Sample using the open live data from Foli to show locations of busses in the map. You can
load the sample by evaluating `(lab.core/load-session! "foli")`, and then evaluating the editor content with `Cmd-Shift-L` to experiment with it yourself.

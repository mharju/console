## Sessions

You can list sessions using `(lab.core/list-sessions!)`, load sessions with `(lab.core/load-session! <session-name>)` and store them using
`(lab.core/store-session! <session-name>)`.

The application hosts default sessions that are stored in `src/lab/experiments` folder.

load the sample using  `(lab.core/load-session "foli")` to experiment with it yourself.
